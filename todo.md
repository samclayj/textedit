## Summary (in one paragraph - unity of the book)

Dr. Ryland Grace is an elementary school teacher and former researcher on alternative lifeforms when a mysterious phenomenon called the Petrova Curve begins cutting off light from the sun. It turns out that an organism - called astrophage - is feeding and breeding around the sun, forcing humanity into a race to find a solution before mass extinction occurs.

Dr. Grace wakes up on the Hail Mary in the Tau Ceti solar system, his crew is dead, and he has no knowledge of how he came to be there or what his mission is. Throughout the novel, snippets of the events leading to his mission are revealed, and he meets an alien - an Eridian - named Rocky who happens to be on the same mission to save his planet. Rocky and Ryland team up, learn each other’s language, and use each other’s abilities to collect astrophage’s natural predator, breed it to live in their environments, and save their planets.

Everything seems to be going well, when Ryland discovers that they have bread taumoeba in such a way that it can withstand nitrogen, but also escape its container and eat their fuel. He goes on a mission to save Rocky, and goes to Erid - saving both Earth and Erid, and redeeming himself for his initial reluctance to sacrifice himself for Earth.

## Would I recommend this book to a friend?

I would! I really enjoyed this book. The science was fun without being too overwhelming, and it was a nice surprise to have this be more of a “buddy” tail with an alien.

## Thoughts

Great reveal - wake up from a coma with memories slowly coming back. Humanity shown into crisis when a single cell organism that feeds and multiplies from stars enters the solar system. This “Astrophage” will block enough sun to cause an ice age in 30 years. Dr. Grace - a high school teacher - is the protagonist. He’s on a ship, he awakens from a coma, his crew is dead, he meets a rock alien.

There was an interesting concept in this book where they have to heat the earth to buy more time - so they melt the polar ice caps with nuke.

I also found it interesting that Human science was more advanced than Eridian science, but Eridian engineering was more advanced than human engineering. The 2 civilizations have actually advanced in different ways based on their sense. Since the Eridian’s have no perception of light, and more advanced/capable brains, they had not invented computers or discovered radiation, or other details about the solar system.

There’s also a concept outlined that Erid and Earth are technologically similar because they both had the right combination of tech to find a star Astrophage didn’t destroy, and the means to get there, but not enough to immediately solve the problem.  This leaves room for more advanced and primitive civilizations in the universe that *did* immediately solve the problem with advanced technology, or just died.

## Quotes

“I grab a nearby test tube and toss it into the air. It goes up and comes down like it should. But it annoys me. Something about falling objects ticks me off right now. I want to know why.”

“I run the numbers and come up with an answer I don’t like. The gravity in this room is too high. It’s 15 meters per second per second when it should be 9.8. That’s why things falling “feel” wrong to me. They’re falling too fast. And that’s why I’m so weak despite these muscles. Everything weighs one and a half times as much as it should.”

“Cool thing about pendulums: The time it takes for one to swing forward and backward—the period—won’t change, no matter how wide it swings. If it’s got a lot of energy, it’ll swing farther and faster, but the period will still be the same. This is what mechanical clocks take advantage of to keep time. That period ends up being driven by two things, and two things only: the length of the pendulum and gravity.”

“Stratt put her hand on his shoulder. “You did what you had to do. We’re all doing what we have to do.” He buried his face in his hands and cried.”

““Everything! Human science better than Eridian science.” He points to the laptop floating beside me. “Machine that think. Eridians no have that.” He points to my toolkit. “Many machines there Eridians no have.””

“I’ve gone from “sole-surviving space explorer” to “guy with wacky new roommate.” It’ll be interesting to see how this plays out.”

““Oh! Wow. Why did it break off?” He wiggles his carapace. “Not know. Many things break. My people make ship very hurry. No time to make sure all things work good.” Deadline-induced quality issues: a problem all over the galaxy.”

“Do you believe in God? I know it’s a personal question. I do. And I think He was pretty awesome to make relativity a thing, don’t you? The faster you go, the less time you experience. It’s like He’s inviting us to explore the universe, you know?””
