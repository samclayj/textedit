**Summary (in one paragraph):**
Pure paranoia. Manic energy. Men doing crazy things, crazy drugs. Hurting people. Paranoid they will be caught. Doing things to avoid being caught. Absolutely no redeeming arcs or character traits. They’re bad people, doing bad things, absolutely addicted to drugs. The book ends and the main character is taking a hit immediately after filling a prescription by impersonating a doctor, after escaping prison or death for his time in Vegas.

* A journalist (Raoul Duke) is sent on assignment to Las Vegas to cover a race in the desert. He brings his “attorney”, a Samoan man who really helps acquire a massive amount of drugs.
* There are flashbacks to the San Francisco drug scene - other trips where they’ve done drugs - the lives they’ve been leading.
* They prepare for the trip with a red convertible, acquiring drugs and a tape recorder.
* They prepare for several wild nights, and check into the press suite.
* The attorney drops acid.
* The timeline is incongruent - it jumps around - you don’t know what’s real.
* “How many more nights and weird mornings can this terrible shit go on? How long can the body and the brain tolerate this doom-struct craziness? This grinding of teeth, this pouring of sweat, this pounding of blood in the temples … small blue vines gone amok in the front of the ears, sixty and seventy hours with no sleep.”
* The attorney threatens to kill Duke while he’s on acid. He threatens to hill himself.
* Fear is pervasive - missing the assignment, the destroyed room, the unplayable bill. Getting caught in Vegas.
* Pulled over by a cop while running from Vegas, but let go. Paranoia makes Duke turn around - they won’t think he’s going back to Vegas (he could have just left).
* The attorney is already set up at a new conference - for cops and DAs - about the war on drugs. They pretend to be cops.
* The attorney kidnaps a girl and gets her high on drugs, they make a plan and drop her off at a different casino.
* The craziness sort of just continues. They do drugs, they break things. They talk their way out of impossible situations - in the latter half of the book by pretending to be undercover cops.
* The book ends with a successful “escape” - Duke drives through the airport perimeter and onto the runway so the attorney can make his flight, and Duke himself drops off the destroyed white convertible (“Whale”), with a story about junkies destroying it, leaves his room without paying the bill, avoids bouncers with his undercover cop story, and makes it to Denver where he immediately starts doing drugs again by pretending to be a doctor.

**Key Takeaways**

Apparently this is related to Gonzo journalism - an artifact of the 60s.

The book has a lot of gruesome descriptions of violence, abuse, sex, etc. Not clear what is real, what is a joke. A lot of rhythm in the sentences. Rising and falling, threats, paranoia.

This book is strange - it’s unsettling, the energy is sort of hard to keep up with. It’s definitely unlike anything else I’ve read.

That being said, I’ve had a hard time finishing it. It’s been a few months at this point (2022-11), and I don’t feel a drive to keep reading.

**Is this similar to any other books I’ve read?**

No, it’s not. Maybe some sort of precursor to a Hangover type story, but even crazier.

**Would I recommend this book to a friend?**
